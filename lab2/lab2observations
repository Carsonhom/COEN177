Step 3:
• Parent and children processes take turns running and printing out
• Sometimes child or parent process will run for loop twice in a row without waiting for the other to run
	• This happened 3 times
Step 4:
3000 microsecond delay
• The program ran similar to step 3
• 3 times when either the parent or child would run for loop twice in a row
	• These happened during later cycles
500 microsecond delay
• Program runs without the child or parent process printing out twice in a row
5000 microsecond delay
• Program runs with 1 instance where the parent process runs twice in a row

Step 6:
• The program ran as expected with a delay of 500 microseconds

• Without any delay, the program failed to run and returned a segmentation fault
