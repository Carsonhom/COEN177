Part 1 step by step process:
1. Use the command cd /usr/src to get to the source folder
2. Next use the command cd kernel to enter the kernel directory
3. Locate the file proc.c and open it using the vi text editor
4. Locate the pick_proc function and add in the code 

int random;	// Random integer between 0 and 100
for(q = 0; q < NR_SCHED_QUEUES; q++) {
		random = rand() % 100; // Initialize value of variable random
		if (randome < 16) // Modify behavior of scheduler
			q = randome;
		else 	// Do not modify behavior of scheduler
			q = 0;

			// Rest of pick_proc code

}

5. Save edits and return to /usr/src directory
6. Recompile MINIX using the make world command and reboot

Part 2 observations:
•After recompiling and rebooting, MINIX ran much slower than normal
•All of the traditional Unix commands worked fine
•Reboot took a very long timex
